        <Header as='h3'>What is Covid 19 ?</Header>
        <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
            coronavirus.
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and
            recover
            without special treatment.
        </p>
        <Header as='h3'>What does Covid stand for ?</Header>
        <p>
            'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was
            referred
            to
            as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.' The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the
            same
            family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.
        </p>
        <Header as='h3'>How dangerous is COVID-19 ?</Header>
        <p>Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill.
            More
            rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical
            conditions
            (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.</p>

        <Header as='h3'>How does the Virus spread ?</Header>
        <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an
            infected
            person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are
            within
            close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then
            your
            eyes, nose or mouth.</p>

        <Header as='h3'>How long does it take for symptoms of the coronavirus
            disease
            to appear ?
        </Header>

        <p>On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to
            show,
            however it can take up to 14 days</p>

        <Header as='h3'>Is temperature screening effective to detect the
            coronavirus
            disease ?</Header>
        <p>Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international
            spread,
            since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms
            early
            on
            in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in
            addition,
            such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits.</p>
